            <p class="hero-abstract">
              Ikigai is an ancient Japanese philosophy that helps shape the
              Japanese people’s ideology in terms of having a complete life.
              Many research point out the association of Ikigai with expanding
              longevity and increasing happiness. In general, Ikigai is the
              intersection of 4 different elements that helps people to identify
              their purpose in life. This article will explore the undeniable
              value of this Japanese philosophy and show some techniques or tips
              people can follow after finding their own Ikigai.

            <div class="definition-info">
              The Japanese construct Ikigai with the sense of “having a purpose
              in life.” Ikigai means “reason for being,” “Iki” means ‘life,’ and
              ‘gai’ describes ‘value.’ Therefore, finding Ikigai means finding
              your calling, what makes you happy, and what makes you want to
              live a complete life other than just exist in this world. The
              original purpose of Ikigai is to find what makes you blissfully
              enjoy your life and is strongly associated with positive health
              improvements, including mental and physical health. When this
              philosophy reached out to Western populations, people here adapted
              it to choose their academic fields or majors to follow and career
              paths.

              like outdoor or indoor activities, or some general concepts like
              you love to make other people stay connected, you love to get to
              know new people and listen to their stories. This sphere is where
              you list all the things you love, whether you are good or bad, or

              <p>This factor includes your hobbies, talents, and things you can effortlessly solve but others can not. For example, you are great at dancing, singing, and creating artwork,...It can also be things that you hear other people compliment you about. This sphere covers everything you are good at regardless of other factors.

              <p>
                Unlike the two factors above, this factor needs you to assess objectively what is happening around you. Researching the market’s trends and labor market needs is a good way to know about this. One thing to keep in mind is the time factor. It is essential to anticipate the potential trends in the labor market to choose the paths that match your plans.

              <p>
               Knowing what you want to do and what other people are willing to pay is important. This sphere encompasses both objective and subjective assessment. It will be helpful if you look up how much the market will pay for each job and ask yourself how much is enough for you to have a complete life. Some people want a wealthy life, and others feel an average income is enough.
